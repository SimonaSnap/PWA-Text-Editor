## Instillation 
On the application window there is a button that the user can click with the word install. That will install the application as a web app onto the user's device.
## Usage 
A user can write/type on the application. The line number can be seen to the left, and there is an example of some of the type art that can be done (the header) which can also be erased if the user wants.
